              Snaking occurs when you drop in before another rider who was waiting before you, essentially queue jumping. At the top of a busy ramp, it's crucial to wait your turn and let those who were waiting before you take their run. If you accidentally snake another user, move out of their way to a safe spot promptly. This practice ensures safety and fairness for everyone in the skatepark.

              The metal pole at the top of most quarter pipes is called the coping, used for grinding and stalling. Avoid hanging your equipment over the coping while waiting your turn, as it obstructs others. Ensure your gear is clear of the coping to allow others to use it effectively. If someone is occupying the ramp you wish to use, politely ask them to move.

              Standing on ramps is hazardous. Skateparks like Rampworx have a flow between ramps, jump-boxes, and rails; standing in the middle can cause accidents. If you fall or lack speed to ascend a ramp, exit the course safely or move aside to let others pass. Before crossing the park, check both ways to ensure it's clear. In case of a collision, apologize to maintain a friendly atmosphere.
